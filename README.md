# randomBG
Python script that selects a random wallpaper from a folder on startup.<br><br>
Simply add your favourite wallpapers to the wallpapers folder (I put some from unsplash and asus), and then run the python program,
which will add a bat file to your startup programs.<br><br>
To stop it from running on startup, simply delete the bat file in your 
(C:\Users\%s\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup) folder, where %s is your username.

# Note
Only works on windows, the function that sets the wallpaper is different for linux, and adding it to startup
would also be different.
